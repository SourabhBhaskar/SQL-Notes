Boolean Data Type in SQL
------------------------
    
    * Introduction
        - A Boolean is a universal data type used in SQL to store true or false values. 
        - It is commonly employed when defining a variable in a table column. 
        - The BOOLEAN data type is used to represent these true or false values.

    * Boolean in MySQL
        - MySQL provides various options for handling Boolean data. 
        - You can use BOOL, BOOLEAN, or TINYINT to represent Boolean values. 
        - Internally, MySQL converts BOOL or BOOLEAN into TINYINT, where TRUE is represented as 1 and FALSE as 0.

    * Boolean in MS SQL Server:
        - MS SQL Server does not have a direct BOOLEAN data type. Instead, you can use the BIT data type to represent Boolean values. 
        - Here, 0 represents FALSE, 1 represents TRUE, and NULL can be used for an unknown value.

    * Filtering Boolean Data
        - You can filter data based on Boolean columns in SQL. For instance:
        - MySQL : SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsRed = TRUE;
        - SQL   : SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsRed = 1;
    
    * Negating Boolean Conditions
        - Negate Boolean conditions to find records that are NOT TRUE. For example:
        - MySQL : SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsRed = 0;
        - SQL   : SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsRed = FALSE;
    
    * Working with NULL Values
        - Handle NULL values in Boolean columns using IS NULL or IS NOT NULL condition in both MySQL and SQL Server. For example:
        - Finding cars with unspecified availability
            SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsAvailable IS NULL;
        - Finding cars with specified availability
            SELECT * FROM CARS WHERE IsAvailable IS NOT NULL;
        - Updating Boolean Values
            Update Boolean values using the UPDATE statement. For example:
            MySQL: UPDATE CARS SET IsRed = TRUE WHERE ID = 123;
            SQL  : UPDATE CARS SET IsRed = 1 WHERE ID = 123;
