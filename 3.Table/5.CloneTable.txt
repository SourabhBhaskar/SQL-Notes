Cloning Tables
--------------
    * In MySQL, there are three types of cloning operations: Simple Cloning, Shallow Cloning, and Deep Cloning. 
        1.Simple Cloning
            - Simple cloning creates a new table with the same structure as the original table and copies all the records into the new table.
            CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;

        2.Shallow Cloning
            - Shallow cloning creates an empty replica table with the same structure as the original table, including column attributes, indices, and AUTO_INCREMENT definition.
            CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;

        3.Deep Cloning
            - Deep cloning combines simple cloning and shallow cloning. 
            It creates a new table with the same structure and copies both the structure and data from the original table.
            CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE original_table;
            INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM original_table;
