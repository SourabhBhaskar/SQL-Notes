SQL LIKE Operator
-----------------
    
    * Introduction
        - The SQL LIKE operator is employed to retrieve data from a column of a table based on a specified pattern. 
        - It is commonly used with the WHERE clause of UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements to filter rows based on a given pattern. Wildcards are used to specify these patterns.

    * Basic Syntax
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE columnn LIKE specified_pattern;
    
    * Wildcards
        - SQL wildcards are special characters used to match patterns in data. 
        - The main wildcards used with the LIKE operator in MySQL are:
        - %: Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
        - _: Represents a single number or character.


    * Usages
