Operator
--------
    * In SQL, operators are special words or characters used in the WHERE clause of a statement to perform operations 
    like comparisons and arithmetic. They help specify conditions and connect multiple conditions in a statement.




Types of SQL Operators
----------------------
    * Arithmetic Operators : Used for mathematical operations on numerical values.
        - Addition (+) : 10 + 20 = 30
        - Subtraction (-) : 20 - 30 = -10
        - Multiplication (*) : 10 * 20 = 200
        - Division (/) : 20 / 10 = 2
        - Modulus (%) : 5 % 2 = 1

    * Comparison Operators : Test whether two expressions are the same or not.
        - Equal to (=) : 5 = 5 returns TRUE
        - Not equal (!= or <>) : 5 != 6 returns TRUE
        - Greater than (>), Less than (<)
        - Greater than or equal to (>=), Less than or equal to (<=)

    * Logical Operators : Test for the truth of given conditions.
        - AND: TRUE if all conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
        - OR: TRUE if any condition separated by OR is TRUE.
        - NOT: Reverses the value of any other Boolean operator.
        - LIKE: TRUE if the operand matches a pattern with wildcard.

    * Operator Precedence: Specifies the sequence in which operators are evaluated.
    Higher precedence operators are evaluated first.
        - SELECT 20 - 3 * 5; (Multiplication evaluated first, then subtraction)
