Outer Join in SQL
----------------

    * Definition
        - Outer Join is a type of join used in SQL to retrieve records from two or more tables, including unmatched records from one or both tables.
        - It ensures that all records from one table are included in the result set, along with matching records from the other table(s).
        - NULL values are used for columns from the table without a match.
    
    * Types of Outer Joins
        - There are three types of outer Joins
        - 1. Left Join
        - 2. Full Join
        - 3. Right Join
    
    * Left Join
        - Retrieves all records from the left (first) table and matching records from the right (second) table.
        - If no match is found in the right table, NULL values are filled for columns from the right table.
        - Syntax
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            LEFT JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

    * Right Join
        - Retrieves all records from the right (second) table and matching records from the left (first) table.
        - If no match is found in the left table, NULL values are filled for columns from the left table.
        - Syntax
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            RIGHT JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
    
    Full Join
        - Retrieves all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
        - Fills unmatched values with NULL for columns from the table without a match.
        - Syntax 
            SELECT column_name(s)
            FROM table1
            FULL JOIN table2
            ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
