SQL BETWEEN Operator
--------------------
    
    * Overview
        - The BETWEEN operator in SQL is a logical operator used to retrieve data within a specified range. It can be applied to integers, characters, or dates.
        - This operator simplifies the condition of checking if a value is within a range, replacing combinations of "greater than equal AND less than equal" conditions.
    
    * SQL BETWEEN Operator Syntax
        SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN
        FROM table_name
        - WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
        - value1: Beginning value of the range.
        - value2: Ending value of the range (inclusive).

    * Retrieving customers aged between 20 and 25
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE BETWEEN 20 AND 25;
    
    * Notes
        - The BETWEEN operator is inclusive, meaning it includes values at both ends of the specified range.
        - It can be used with different data types, including numeric and character data.
