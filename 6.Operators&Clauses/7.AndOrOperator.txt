SQL - AND and OR Conjunctive Operators
--------------------------------------
    
    * Operators in SQL
        - Operators are reserved words primarily used in SQL to perform various operations on data, like addition (+), subtraction (-), or comparison (==).

    * Conjunctive Operators
        - Conjunctive operators, used in boolean logic, combine two conditions in an SQL statement. The most common ones are:
        - AND (&&) : Returns true if both conditions are true.
        - OR (||) : Returns true if at least one condition is true.

    * AND Operator
        1.Syntax
            WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2];
            - Conditions are combined using the AND operator.
            - N number of conditions can be combined.
            - All specified conditions must be TRUE for the action to be taken.

        2.With multiple condition
            WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2] AND [condition3];
            - Multiple AND operators can be used.
            - Conditions are evaluated from left to right.
            - If any condition is false, the entire condition is false.
        

    * OR operator
        1.Syntax
            WHERE [condition1] OR [condition2];
            - Conditions are combined using the OR operator.
            - At least one condition must be TRUE for the action to be taken.
    
        2.Multiple OR Operators
            WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3;
            Multiple OR operators can be used.
            Rows meeting at least one condition are included in the result-set.
    
    * OR with AND Operator
        WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);
        - AND and OR can be combined with each other.
        - Parentheses control the order of operations.
        - AND and OR operators can be combined.
        - Parentheses control the order of evaluation.
