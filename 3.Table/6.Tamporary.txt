Temporary Tables 
----------------
    * Definition
        - Created to store temporary data.
        - Supports SQL operations similar to permanent tables (e.g., CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, JOIN).
        - Automatically deleted when the client session ends; can be explicitly deleted by users.
    
    * Lifespan
        - Exist only during the client session.
        - Automatic destruction in PHP scripts after script execution.
        - Exist until the MySQL client connection is closed or manually deleted.

    * Creating Temporary Tables 
        - Syntax: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, ..., PRIMARY KEY(one or more columns));

    * Inserting Data into MySQL Temporary Tables
        -Use INSERT INTO similar to regular tables.

    * Temporary tables not listed in SHOW TABLES.

    * MySQL-Specific Error Handling
        - If attempting to retrieve data after removal, MySQL generates an error.
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
        - Generates: ERROR 1146: Table 'TUTORIALS.CUSTOMERS' doesn't exist
    
    * MySQL and SQL Server Comparison
        - In MySQL, temporary tables are only visible within the current session.
        - In SQL Server, both local and global temporary tables exist.
    
    * Local Temporary Tables in MySQL
        - Created using a single # as the prefix.

    * Global Temporary Tables in MySQL
        - Created using ## as the prefix.

    * Dropping Temporary Tables in MySQL
        - Manual deletion using DROP TABLE with # for local and ## for global.
        DROP TABLE #Customers;
        DROP TABLE ##Buyers;
