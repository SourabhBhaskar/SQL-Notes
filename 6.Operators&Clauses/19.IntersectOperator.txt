SQL INTERSECT Operator
----------------------
    
    * Definition
        - The INTERSECT operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two SELECT statements and retrieve only the common rows between them. 
        - It returns distinct rows that appear in both result sets.

    * Syntax
        - column1, column2, ...: Columns selected from the tables participating in the INTERSECT.
        - table1, table2, ...: Tables from which data is selected.
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
        INTERSECT
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2;

    * Notes
        - Column Count and Data Types: The number of columns and their data types must be the same in both SELECT statements involved in the INTERSECT operation.
        - Column Aliasing: It's common to use column aliases to ensure that the result set has meaningful column names.
