SQL INSERT INTO Statement
-------------------------

    * Definition
        - The SQL INSERT INTO Statement is used to add new rows of data into a table in the database.
        - It is supported by almost all relational database management systems (RDBMS).
    
    * Syntax
        1. Using column names:
            INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (column1, column2, ... columnN) VALUES (value1, value2, ... valueN);
        2. Without specifying column names (order must match the table's column order):
            INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1, value2, ... valueN);

    * Inserting Data Using Another Table (INSERT... SELECT):
        INSERT INTO BUYERS (ID, NAME, AGE) SELECT ID, NAME, AGE FROM CUSTOMERS;

    * Inserting Data Using Another Table (INSERT... TABLE):
        INSERT INTO first_table_name TABLE second_table_name;

    * Note
        - Ensure data types match the columns.
        - If a column is defined as NOT NULL, provide a value for it.
        - These statements provide flexibility in inserting data from one table into another based on specific requirements.
        - Column count & type should be same as selecting field
