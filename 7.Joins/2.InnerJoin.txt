SQL Inner Join
--------------
    * The SQL Inner Join combines multiple tables by retrieving records with matching values in both tables (in the common column).
    Also known as Equijoin, it is the default join; "JOIN" and "INNER JOIN" are often used interchangeably.
    
    * Explanation
        - Inner Join compares each row of the first table with each row of the second table based on the join-predicate.
        = When the join-predicate is satisfied, column values from both tables are combined into a new table.
    
    * Syntax of Inner Join
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table1
        INNER JOIN table2
        ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

    * Joining Multiple Tables Using Inner Join
        - Multiple tables can be joined sequentially using INNER JOIN.
        - Syntax:
            SELECT column1, column2, column3...
            FROM table1
            INNER JOIN table2
            ON condition_1
            INNER JOIN table3
            ON condition_2
            ...
            INNER JOIN tableN
            ON condition_N;

    * Inner Join with WHERE Clause
        - The WHERE clause is used to apply additional constraints on the data retrieved by Inner Join.
        SELECT ID, NAME, DATE, AMOUNT
        FROM CUSTOMERS
        INNER JOIN ORDERS
        ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID
        WHERE ORDERS.AMOUNT > 2000.00;
