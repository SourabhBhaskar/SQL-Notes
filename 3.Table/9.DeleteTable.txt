DELETE Command 
-------------

    * Definition
        - Statement Type: Data Manipulation Language (DML)
        - Purpose: Deletes data from a table without altering the table structure.
        - Scope: Operates on a single table at a time.
        - Effect on Table: Constraints, indexes, triggers, and table structure remain unaffected.
    
    * Basic Syntax
        DELETE FROM table_name;
    
    * Deleting Specific Rows with WHERE Clause:
        - Syntax : DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

    * Verification
        - After the deletion, the SELECT query shows the modified table.
    
    * Deleting Rows Based on Multiple Conditions
        - Syntax : DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND/OR condition2 ... AND/OR conditionN;

    * Deleting All Records in a Table
        - DELETE FROM table_name;

    * Important Notes:
        - Caution: Deletion without WHERE clause removes all records irreversibly.
        - Performance Impact: Deleting large datasets can be resource-intensive.
        - Undo Capability: Deletion cannot be undone; backup data before mass deletion
