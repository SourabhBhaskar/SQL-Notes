SQL Primary Key
---------------
    
    * Overview
        - The SQL Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a database table, facilitating data access and establishing relationships between tables.
        - While a table can have only one Primary Key, it can be defined on one or more fields, forming a Composite Key.
    
    * Points to Remember
        - Contains only unique values.
        - Cannot be null.
        - One table can have only one Primary Key.
        - The length of a primary key cannot exceed 900 bytes.
    
    * Creating an SQL Primary Key
        CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
            ID INT NOT NULL,
            NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
            AGE INT NOT NULL,
            ADDRESS CHAR(25),
            SALARY DECIMAL(18, 2),       
            PRIMARY KEY (ID)
        );
    
    * Creating Primary Key on an Existing Column
        ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS ADD CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY(NAME);
    
    * Dropping an SQL Primary Key
        ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS DROP PRIMARY KEY;
