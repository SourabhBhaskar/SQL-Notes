SQL INSERT INTO... SELECT statement
-----------------------------------

    * Definition
        - The SQL INSERT INTO... SELECT statement is used to add or insert one or more new rows from an existing table to another table. 
        - It combines the INSERT INTO and SELECT statements.
    
    * Syntax
        INSERT INTO BUYERS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
    
    * Note
        - The SQL INSERT INTO... SELECT statement adds or inserts rows from a source table to a target table.
        - The source and target tables must have the same structure.
        - Constraints and data types of the source data should match the target table.
        - It's essential to ensure that the data being inserted satisfies the constraints of the target table.
        - You can use a WHERE clause to filter specific records while copying.
        - The LIMIT clause can be used to insert a specific number of rows (e.g., top N rows) from the source table.
        - The SQL INSERT INTO... SELECT statement is a useful way to copy data between tables efficiently.
