SQL Wildcards
-------------
    
    * Overview
        - SQL Wildcards are special characters used with the LIKE operator to search for specific patterns in strings or compare various strings.
        - The LIKE operator is case-sensitive, matching only strings with the exact case as the specified pattern.
    
    * Commonly Used Wildcards
        1. Percent Sign (%) : Matches one or more characters.
        2. Underscore (_)   :  Matches one character.

    * Syntax
        SELECT * FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name LIKE [wildcard_pattern];
        - Combine conditions using AND or OR operators.
        - [wildcard_pattern] can represent any numeric or string value.
    
    * Examples
        - Finds values starting with 200.
        WHERE SALARY LIKE '%200%'

        - Finds values with 200 in any position.
