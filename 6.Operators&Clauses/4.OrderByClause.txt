SQL ORDER BY Clause
-------------------
    * Overview
        - The SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort data in either ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
        - It is used with the SQL SELECT statement and is specified after the WHERE, HAVING, and GROUP BY clauses.
        - Sorting can be done by a single column or multiple columns, helpful for hierarchical sorting.
    
    * Syntax
        SELECT column1, column2, ... columnN 
        FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;
            - ASC: Ascending order (default if not specified).
            - DESC: Descending order.
            - ASC and DESC
            - ASC is the default sort order.
            - To sort in ascending order, ASC is optional.
            - To sort in descending order, use DESC.

    * Sort CUSTOMERS table by name in ascending order
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY NAME ASC;
    
    * Sorting by Multiple Columns
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY AGE ASC, SALARY DESC;
        - Use ORDER BY with multiple columns for hierarchical sorting.
        - Sorting is done in the order specified in the clause.
    
    * ORDER BY with WHERE Clause
        - Use WHERE clause with ORDER BY to sort rows that meet certain conditions.
        - Useful for sorting a subset of data based on specific criteria.
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25 ORDER BY NAME DESC;
    
    * ORDER BY with LIMIT Clause
        - Use LIMIT with ORDER BY to limit rows and specify sorting.
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        ORDER BY column_name1 [ASC | DESC], column_name2 [ASC | DESC], ...
        LIMIT N;

    
    * Sorting in a Preferred Order
        - Use the CASE statement within ORDER BY to sort records in a custom order.
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY (
        CASE ADDRESS
            WHEN 'MUMBAI' THEN 1
            WHEN 'DELHI' THEN 2
            WHEN 'HYDERABAD' THEN 3
            WHEN 'AHMEDABAD' THEN 4
            WHEN 'INDORE' THEN 5
            WHEN 'BHOPAL' THEN 6
            WHEN 'KOTA' THEN 7
            ELSE 100 END
        );
