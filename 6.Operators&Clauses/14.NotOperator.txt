SQL NOT Operator
----------------
    
    * Overview
        -The SQL NOT operator is a logical operator used to negate a condition or Boolean expression in a WHERE clause.
        - It reverses the result of a condition, turning TRUE into FALSE and vice versa.
        - Useful when specifying what records to exclude rather than include in the result.
    
    * Syntax
        NOT [CONDITION or BOOLEAN EXPRESSION];
        CONDITION or BOOLEAN EXPRESSION: The condition to be negated.


    * Using NOT to retrieve rows where SALARY is not greater than 2000.00
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NOT (SALARY > 2000.00);

    * Use Cases
        1.Excluding Records
            - Use NOT to exclude records that do not meet specific conditions.
        2.Negating LIKE Operations
            - Use NOT with LIKE to find records that do not match a specified pattern.
        3.Excluding Values in a Range
            - Use NOT with IN or BETWEEN to exclude records falling within a specified range.
        4.Filtering NULL Values
            - Use NOT with IS NULL to exclude records with NULL values.
        5.Negating EXISTS Checks
            - Use NOT with EXISTS to find records that do not exist in another table.
