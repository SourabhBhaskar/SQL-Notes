Database Overview
-----------------
    * A database is a structured collection of data stored in a computer system. It efficiently stores and retrieves data.
    Query Languages: Different query languages can be used to create databases, with SQL being a prominent language.

    * CREATE Database Statement
        - The CREATE DATABASE statement is a DDL (Data Definition Language) statement used to create a new database in SQL.
        - Syntax : CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName;
        - DatabaseName: Name of the database to be created, using valid identifiers (numbers, letters, underscores). It cannot be an SQL keyword.
        - On Linux or Unix, database names are case-sensitive, but SQL keywords are case-insensitive. Windows doesn't have this restriction.
        - When creating a database, if you encounter an error like ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'user'@'localhost' to database 'DatabaseName', it indicates insufficient privileges. Admin privileges are needed.

    * List Databases using SQL:
        - After creating a database, you can check the list of databases using the SHOW DATABASES; command.
        - Syntax : SHOW DATABASES;

    * Use/Select Databases using SQL:
        - Set the newly created database as the default using the USE statement.
        - Syntax : USE testDB;
