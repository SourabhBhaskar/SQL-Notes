Table 
-----
    1. CREATE TABLE 
        - The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.  
        CREATE TABLE table_name(
            column1 DATATYPE,
            column2 DATATYPE,
            ....
        )
    
    2. SHOW TABLES
        - In MySQL, you can use the SHOW TABLES statement to list all the tables in the current database. 
        SHOW TABLES;

    3. RENAME TABLE 
        - This command renames the CUSTOMERS table to BUYERS. 
        - You should ensure that there is no table with the new name already existing.
        RENAME TABLE old_name TO new_name

    4. ALTER TABLE... RENAME TO
        - This command renames the CUSTOMERS table to BUYERS.

            - Maps a column to another table; uniquely identifies a record.
            CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                CUSTOMER_ID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(ID),
            );

        6.CHECK Value Constraint
            - Validates data entered into a column based on specified conditions.
            CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                AGE INT CHECK(AGE>=18),
            );

        7.INDEX Constraint
            - Speeds up data retrieval; can be Unique or Non-Unique.
            CREATE INDEX idx_age ON CUSTOMERS ( AGE );
        
        8.Dropping Constraints
            ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
            ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS DROP CONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY;
