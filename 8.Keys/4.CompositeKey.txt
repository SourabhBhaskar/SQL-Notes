SQL Composite Key
-----------------

    * Definition
        - SQL Composite Key is a key defined on two or more columns in a table to uniquely identify records.
        - Also known as a Primary Key created on multiple columns.
    
    * Use Cases
        - Necessary when a table lacks a single column for unique identification.
        - Combination of columns used to ensure distinct and identifiable records.

    * Features
        - Created by combining more than one Candidate Key.
        - Each Candidate Key may or may not be a Foreign Key.
        - If all columns in the Composite Key are Foreign Keys, it's known as a Compound Key.
        - Cannot be NULL; individual columns must not contain NULL values.
        - Individual columns can have duplicate values, but the combination must be unique.
    
    * Syntax
        CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
            ID INT NOT NULL,
            NAME VARCHAR (20) NOT NULL,
            AGE INT NOT NULL,
            ADDRESS CHAR (25),
            SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),       
            CONSTRAINT ck_customers 
            PRIMARY KEY (ID, NAME)
        );

    * Dropping Composite Key in MySQL
        ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;
    
    * Dropping Composite Key in SQL Server:
        ALTER TABLE table_name DROP composite_key_name;
