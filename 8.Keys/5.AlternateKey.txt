SQL Alternate Key
-----------------
    * Definition
        - SQL Alternate Keys are candidate keys not selected as the primary key.
        - Used to uniquely identify a tuple or record in a table.
    
    * Syntax
        - No specific query or syntax to set an alternate key.
        - It's a column that's a close second candidate for primary key selection.
    
    * Use Case
        - Table: CUSTOMERS with columns ID, NAME, AGE, AADHAAR_ID, MOBILE_NO, SALARY.
        - Candidate Keys: ID, AADHAAR_ID, MOBILE_NO.
        - If ID is the primary key, AADHAAR_ID and MOBILE_NO are alternate keys.
    
    * Features
        - Does not allow duplicate values.
        - A table can have more than one alternate key.
        - Can contain NULL values unless NOT NULL constraint is set.
        - All alternate keys can be candidate keys, but not all candidate keys can be alternate keys.
        - The primary key, also a candidate key, cannot be considered as an alternate key.
    
    * Example Table Creation
        CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
            ID INT,
            NAME VARCHAR (20),
            AGE INT,
            AADHAAR_ID BIGINT,
            MOBILE_NO BIGINT,
            SALARY DECIMAL (18, 2),
            PRIMARY KEY(ID)      
        );

    * Candidate Key
        - Subset of super keys uniquely identifying records.
        - Includes primary keys, alternate keys, and foreign keys.
    
    * Primary Key
        - Main key for retrieving records.
        - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
    
    * Foreign Key
        - Primary key of one table serving as a foreign key in another.
        - Values in foreign key field must match primary key values.
    
    * Alternate Key
        - Candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.
        - Uniquely identifies records in a table.
