SQL TOP Clause Notes
--------------------
   * Overview
      - The SQL TOP clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a SELECT query in SQL Server.
      - It can also be applied to UPDATE and DELETE statements to limit the resultant records.

   * Syntax
      - value: Number or percentage of rows to return from the top.
      - SQL Server
         SELECT TOP value column_name(s)
         FROM table_name
         WHERE [condition];
      - MySQL
         SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table_name
         WHERE [condition]
         LIMIT value;

   * Basic TOP Usage
      1. Fetch the top 4 records from the CUSTOMERS table
         - SQL Server
            SELECT TOP 4 * FROM CUSTOMERS;
         - MySQL
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS LIMIT 4;

      2. TOP with ORDER BY Clause
         - Fetch the top 4 records from CUSTOMERS, sorted by salary in descending order
         - SQL Server
            SELECT TOP 4 * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY SALARY DESC;
         - MySQL
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 4;

      3. TOP with WHERE Clause
         - Fetch the top 2 records from CUSTOMERS where the name starts with 'K'
         - SQL Server
            SELECT TOP 2 * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'K%';
         - MySQL
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'K%' LIMIT 2;

      4. TOP Clause With DELETE Statement
         - Delete the top 2 customers whose names start with 'K'
         - SQL Server
            DELETE TOP(2) FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'K%';
         - MySQL
            DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'K%' LIMIT 2;

      5. TOP and WITH TIES Clause
         - Fetch the top 2 records from CUSTOMERS with tied values in salary
         - SQL Server
            SELECT TOP 2 WITH TIES * FROM CUSTOMERS ORDER BY SALARY;
         - MySQL (Equivalent not directly supported)
            - To achieve similar functionality, you may need to use a subquery or multiple queries.

   * Uses of TOP Clause
      - Pagination: Manage and efficiently display large sets of data.
      - Sampling Data: Quickly retrieve a sample of data for testing or analysis.
      - Performance Improvement: Enhance query performance, especially for large tables.
      - Debugging: Test query correctness by limiting rows.
      - Data Visualization: Limit rows for creating charts or graphs.
