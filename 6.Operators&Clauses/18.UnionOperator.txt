SQL UNION Operator
-----------------

    * Definition
        - The UNION operator in SQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. 
        - It is important to note that the number of columns, column data types, and their order in the SELECT statements must be the same for the UNION operation to be successful.

    * Syntax
        - column1, column2, ...: Columns selected from the tables participating in the UNION.
        - table1, table2, ...: Tables from which data is selected.
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
        UNION
        SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2;

    * Notes
        - Column Count and Data Types: The number of columns and their data types must be the same in all SELECT statements involved in the UNION operation.
        - Column Aliasing: It's common to use column aliases to ensure that the result set has meaningful column names. In the example above, 'Type' is an alias for a constant value representing the source of each record.
        - Duplicate Rows: By default, the UNION operator removes duplicate rows from the result set. If you want to include duplicate rows, you can use the UNION ALL operator.
