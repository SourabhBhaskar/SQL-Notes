SQL Datatypes
-------------
    * An SQL data type refers to the type of data which can be stored in a column of a database table. 
    For example integer data, character data, monetary data, date and time data, binary strings, and so on.

    * Different RDBMS supports different type of data types to define their tables.

    * Types of SQL Datatypes
        - String        
        - Numeric       
        - Date and Time

        - Variable-length string.
        - Can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
        - Size is the maximum string length in characters (0 to 65535).

    * BINARY(size)
        - Similar to CHAR() but stores binary byte strings.
        - Size defines the length in bytes, default is 1.

    * VARBINARY(size)
        - Similar to VARCHAR() but stores binary byte strings.
