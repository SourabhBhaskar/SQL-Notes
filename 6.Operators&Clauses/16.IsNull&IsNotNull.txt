SQL : IS NULL
-----------
    * Overview
        - In SQL, fields with NULL values indicate the absence of data. 
        - SQL allows the creation or modification of records without specifying values for certain fields, resulting in NULL values.
        - To handle NULL values, SQL provides the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators for checking whether a value in a column is NULL or not.
        
    * SQL IS NULL Operator
        - The IS NULL operator checks whether a value in a column is NULL, returning true if the value is NULL and false otherwise.
        - Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN FROM table_name WHERE columnN IS NULL;
        - Retrieving records where ADDRESS is NULL
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ADDRESS IS NULL;

    * SQL IS NOT NULL Operator
        - The IS NULL operator checks whether a value in a column is not NULL, returning true if the value is not NULL and false otherwise.
        - Syntax: SELECT column1, column2, ..., columnN FROM table_name WHERE columnN IS NOT NULL;
        - Retrieving records where ADDRESS is not NULL
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ADDRESS IS NOT NULL;
    
    * Notes
        - NULL represents missing or undefined data in SQL.
        - IS NULL and IS NOT NULL are used to filter records based on the presence or absence of NULL values in a column.
        - Both can be combined with various SQL statements like SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE for different operations.
        - Be cautious when dealing with NULL values to avoid unintended results.
