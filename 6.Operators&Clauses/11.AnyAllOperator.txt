SQL ANY and ALL Operators
-------------------------
    
    * Introduction
        - The SQL ANY and ALL operators are utilized to perform a comparison between a single value and a range of values returned by a subquery. 
        - They are preceded by a standard comparison operator (e.g., >, >=, <, <=, =, <>, !=) and followed by a subquery. 
        - The key difference is that ANY returns true if any subquery value meets the condition, while ALL returns true if all subquery values meet the condition.

    * SQL ANY Operator
        - This operator returns a TRUE, if the given condition is satisfied for any of the values in the range.
        - Verify if any single record satisfies a required condition.
        - Used with a subquery for complex comparisons.
        - Simplifies complex queries.
        - To list details of customers whose SALARY is greater than the SALARY of any customer whose AGE is 32
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
            WHERE SALARY > ANY (SELECT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 32);

    * SQL ANY Operator
        - This operator returns a TRUE, if the given condition is satisfied for any of the values in the range.
        - Returns all records of a SELECT statement.
        - Useful with WHERE and HAVING clauses.
        - Compares values against all records in the subquery.
        - To list details of customers whose SALARY is greater than the SALARY of all customer whose AGE is 32
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS 
            WHERE SALARY > ALL (SELECT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 32);
