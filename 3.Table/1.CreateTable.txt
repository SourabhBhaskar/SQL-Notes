Table Creation Simplified
-------------------------
    * In relational database management systems (RDBMS), tables are fundamental structures used to store data. 
    SQL provides powerful queries for interacting with tables, including creating, deleting, and manipulating data within them.
    
    * SQL CREATE TABLE Statement
        - The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database. 
        - It defines the structure of the table, including the names of columns, their data types, and any constraints.
            CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
                AGE INT NOT NULL,
                ADDRESS CHAR(25),
                SALARY DECIMAL(18, 2),
                PRIMARY KEY (ID)
            );

    * CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
        - To avoid errors when trying to create a table that already exists, you can use the IF NOT EXISTS clause
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CUSTOMERS (
                ID INT NOT NULL,
                NAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
                AGE INT NOT NULL,
                ADDRESS CHAR(25),
                SALARY DECIMAL(18, 2),
                PRIMARY KEY (ID)
            );

    * Creating a Table from an Existing Table
        - To create a table with the same structure and data as an existing table, you can use the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement:
            CREATE TABLE SALARY AS
            SELECT ID, SALARY
            FROM CUSTOMERS;
