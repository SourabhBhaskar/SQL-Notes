SQL Aliases
-----------

    * Definition
        - Aliases in SQL are temporary names assigned to tables or columns in a query. 
        - They are used to make queries more readable, especially when dealing with complex statements involving multiple tables or columns. 
        - Aliases can be applied to both tables and columns.

    * Syntax
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name AS alias_name;

    * Creating aliases for the CUSTOMERS and ORDERS tables
        SELECT C.ID, C.NAME, C.AGE, O.AMOUNT 
        FROM CUSTOMERS AS C, ORDERS AS O
        WHERE  C.ID = O.CUSTOMER_ID;

    * Notes
        - Readability: Aliases enhance the readability of queries, especially when dealing with long or complex statements.
        - Avoiding Ambiguity: In self-joins or queries involving multiple tables with similar column names, aliases prevent ambiguity.
        - Temporary Nature: Aliases are temporary and exist only for the duration of the query.
        - AS Keyword: While the use of 'AS' is optional when creating aliases, it is a good practice to include it for clarity.
