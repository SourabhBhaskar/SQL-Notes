SQL CASE Statement
------------------
    * Overview
        - The SQL CASE statement is a conditional statement used for decision-making based on a set of conditions.
        - It evaluates conditions and returns corresponding values when a condition is met.
        - Similar to an IF-THEN-ELSE statement, it allows multiple conditions to be tested.
    
    * Syntax
        CASE
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ...
        ELSE default_result
        END;
        - condition1, condition2, etc.: Conditional statements to be evaluated.
        - result1, result2, etc.: Values returned when the corresponding condition is true.
        - default_result: Value returned if none of the conditions are true.

    * Using CASE to categorize customers based on age
        SELECT NAME, AGE,
        CASE 
        WHEN AGE > 30 THEN 'Gen X'
        WHEN AGE > 25 THEN 'Gen Y'
        WHEN AGE > 22 THEN 'Gen Z'
        ELSE 'Gen Alpha' 
        END AS Generation
        FROM CUSTOMERS;

    * Using CASE with UPDATE to modify salaries based on age
        UPDATE CUSTOMERS
        SET SALARY = 
        CASE 
        WHEN AGE = 25 THEN 17000
        WHEN AGE = 32 THEN 25000
        ELSE 12000
        END;

    * Using CASE with INSERT to add a new record
        INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID, NAME, AGE, ADDRESS, SALARY)
        VALUES (10, 'Viren', 28, 'Varanasi', 
        CASE 
            WHEN AGE >= 25 THEN 23000
            ELSE 14000
        END
        );

    * Use Cases
        - Conditional Column Creation: Creating a new column based on conditions in existing columns.
        - Sorting and Grouping: Sorting or grouping query results based on specific conditions.
        - Conditional Updates: Updating table values based on specified conditions.
        - Conditional Inserts: Inserting data into tables with conditions determining the values.
        - Filtering and Categorizing:Filtering rows or categorizing data based on specific criteria.
    
    * Notes
        - The CASE statement provides a powerful way to handle conditional logic within SQL queries.
        - It can be used in SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and other SQL statements.
        - A versatile tool for data manipulation and decision-making within the database.
