SQL NOT EQUAL Operator
----------------------
    
    * Overview
        - The SQL NOT EQUAL operator (<> or !=) is used to compare two values and return true if they are not equal.
        - The difference between <> and != lies in adherence to the ISO standard; <> follows the standard, while != doesn't. It is recommended to use <>.
    
    * Syntax
        WHERE expression1 <> expression2;
        - expression1 and expression2: Values or expressions to be compared.
    

    * Using NOT EQUAL to retrieve rows where NAME is not 'Ramesh'
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME <> 'Ramesh';
    
    * Use Cases
        1.Excluding Specific Values
            - Use NOT EQUAL to exclude rows where a particular column has a specific value.
        2.Grouping by Non-Equal Values
            - Use NOT EQUAL with GROUP BY to group results by values that are not equal to a specified value.
        3.Multiple Conditions with NOT EQUAL
            - Use NOT EQUAL with multiple conditions to filter rows based on complex criteria.
        4.Negating a Condition
            - Combine NOT EQUAL with the NOT Operator to negate a specific condition.
   
    * Notes
        - SQL NOT EQUAL is useful for excluding specific values or grouping results based on non-equal conditions.
        - It is case-sensitive by default, even when used with text values.
        - Consider using <> for better adherence to ISO standards.
