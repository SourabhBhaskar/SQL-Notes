SQL UPDATE Statement
-------------------

    * Definition
        - The SQL UPDATE statement is utilized to modify existing records in a table. 
        - It is a crucial part of Data Manipulation Language (DML), 
        focusing solely on altering the data within a table without affecting its structure.

    * Syntax
        UPDATE table_name
        SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ..., columnN = valueN
        WHERE [condition];
        table_name: The name of the table to be updated.
        - column1, column2, ..., columnN: The columns to be updated.
        - value1, value2, ..., valueN: The new values assigned to the specified columns.
        - WHERE [condition]: An optional clause specifying the conditions that must be met for the update to occur. If omitted, all rows in the table will be affected.

    * Update Multiple Rows and Columns
        - Multiple rows and columns in a table can be updated using the SQL UPDATE statement. 
        - Use the WHERE clause to filter the rows to be updated, and assign new values to the desired columns.
        UPDATE CUSTOMERS
        SET AGE = AGE + 5, SALARY = SALARY + 3000;


    * Note
        - Exercise caution while using the SQL UPDATE statement, ensuring that the WHERE clause is appropriately set to update the desired records. 
        - Failure to do so may result in unintended modifications to the entire table.
