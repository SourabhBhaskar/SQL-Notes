SQL Expressions
---------------
    * In SQL, an expression is a combination of values, operators, and functions that evaluates to a single value. 
    These expressions are commonly used in the WHERE clause of SQL statements to filter records based on specific conditions.


    * Basic Syntax
        SELECT column1, column2, columnN
        FROM table_name
        WHERE [CONDITION|EXPRESSION];


    * Types of SQL Expressions
        1.Boolean Expressions : Check for equality or use logical operators.
            - Return TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN;
            SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY = 10000;

        2.Numeric Expressions
            - Use arithmetic operators for mathematical operations.
            - Operands must be numerals, and the result is always a number.
            SELECT 15 + 6;
            SELECT AVG(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;

        3.Date Expressions
            - Used to compare date-related values with the current system date and time.
            SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
            SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE DATE < '2008-06-01';
