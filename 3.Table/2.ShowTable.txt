Listing Tables
--------------
    * In MySQL, you can use the SHOW TABLES statement to list all the tables in the current database. 
    
    * Syntax
        SHOW TABLES;
    +------------------+
    | Tables_in_dbname |
    +------------------+
    | table1           |
    | table2           |
    | table3           |
    | ...              |
    +------------------+
        - This command will display a list of tables in the specified database.
        - Keep in mind that this command will only show tables for the currently selected database (your_database_name). 
        If you want to see tables from a different database, you need to switch to that database using the USE statement.
