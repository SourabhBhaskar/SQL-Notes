SQL SELECT INTO Statement
-------------------------

    * Definition
        - The SQL SELECT INTO Statement creates a new table and inserts data from an existing table into the newly created table.
    
    * Syntax
        1. Copying all columns      : SELECT * INTO CUSTOMER_BACKUP FROM CUSTOMERS;
        2. Copying specific columns : SELECT name, age, address INTO CUSTOMER_DETAILS FROM CUSTOMERS;

    * Copying Data From Multiple Tables:
        SELECT CUSTOMERS.Name, ORDERS.customer_id INTO CUSTOMER_ORDERS
        FROM CUSTOMERS
        LEFT JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.customer_id;
    
    * Note

        - The SQL SELECT INTO statement is used to create a new table and populate it with data from an existing table.
        - The new table is automatically created based on the columns in the SELECT statement.
        - Indexes, constraints, and other properties of the original table are not preserved in the new table.
        - You may need to add these properties manually to the new table if necessary.
        - In MySQL, the SELECT INTO statement is not supported; instead, you can use INSERT INTO ... SELECT or CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
