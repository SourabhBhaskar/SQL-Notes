Drop database
-------------  
    * The DROP DATABASE statement is used to delete an existing database in SQL. 
    This includes all associated data such as tables, views, indexes, stored procedures, and constraints.
    
    * Important Points
        - Backup: Ensure a proper backup of the database is taken before deletion.
        - Connections: No other applications should be connected to or using the database being deleted.
        - Privileges: Necessary privileges are required, usually by an admin, to delete the database.
    
    * Syntax
        DROP DATABASE DatabaseName;
        - DatabaseName: The name of the database to be deleted. It is unique within the RDBMS.

    * DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Statement
        - The DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS statement includes a condition to check if the database exists before attempting deletion. 
        If the database doesn't exist, no error is raised, and the statement terminates without any action.
        Syntax : DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS DatabaseName;

    * Deleting multiple databases (e.g., testDB3, testDB4)
        DROP DATABASE testDB3, testDB4;
