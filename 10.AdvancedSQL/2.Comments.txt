SQL comments
------------
    
    * Overview
        - Comments in programming languages provide additional information, aiding in code understanding without affecting functionality.
        - In SQL, comments explain query sections or skip statement execution.
    
    * Types of SQL Comments
        1. Single-line comments : Start with two consecutive hyphens (--) and extend to the end of the line.
            -- This is a single-line comment

        2. Multi-line comments  : Start with /* and end with */.
            - Ignore and comment out multiple lines or a block of SQL code.
            /* This is a
            multi-line
            comment */
    
    * Notes
        - SQL comments enhance code readability and can be single-line (--) or multi-line (/*...*/).
        - Single-line comments extend to the end of the line, while multi-line comments can span multiple lines or blocks of code.
